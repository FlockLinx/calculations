social network influence spread

you are given a directed graph representing a social network and a set of initially "influenced" nodes.
determine how influence spreads throught the network over time. A node becomes influenced if at least k
of its incoming neighbors are already influenced. return the total number of influenced nodes after
the influence has fully propagated.

Problem statement

Given a directed graph where each edge represents a social connection (follower relationship), and an initial
set of influenced nodes, simulate thespread of influence through the network. In each round, a node becomes
influenced if it has at least k influenced neighbors pointing to it (incomming edges from influenced nodes).

The process continues until no new nodes can be influenced in a round.

Rules

Influence spread in discrete rounds
A node becomes influenced if it has at least K influenced incoming neighbors
Once a node is influenced, it remains influenced
The process stops when no new nodes are influenced in a round
Return the total count of influenced nodes at the end

Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000 (number of nodes)
0 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1)
1 <= k <= n (threshold for influence)
1 <= initial.length <= n (initially influenced nodes)
Node IDs are in range [0, n-1]
No self-loops or duplicate edges
Graph may have cycles

examples


inputs:

n = 6

edges = [[0,2], [1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[3,5],[4,5],[1,3]....]
k = 2
initial = [0,1]
